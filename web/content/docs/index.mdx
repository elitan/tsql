## Introduction

tSQL is a type-safe SQL query builder and database toolkit for TypeScript.

```ts
const users = await db
  .selectFrom("users")
  .select(["id", "name", "email"])
  .execute();

// users is now typed as { id: number; name: string; email: string }[]
```

## Features

- **Fluent API**: Fully type-safe SQL query builder with a fluent API.
- **Automatic Type Generation**: Automatic type generation from your database schema.
- **Multi-Dialect Support**: Compatible with popular SQL databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL.
