The `having` clause filters grouped results in your SQL queries. Unlike `where` which filters individual rows, `having` works with aggregated data after grouping has been performed.

```typescript
db.selectFrom('orders')
  .select(['category', (eb) => eb.fn.sum('amount').as('total_amount')])
  .groupBy('category')
  .having('total_amount', '>', 1000)
  .execute()
```
