Plugins in Kysely are powerful extensions that modify or enhance query behavior. Each plugin is implemented as a class that conforms to the `KyselyPlugin` interface.

## Adding Plugins

To use plugins, add them to your Kysely database instance configuration:

```typescript
const db = new Kysely<Database>({
  dialect: new PostgresDialect({
    database: 'kysely_test',
    host: 'localhost',
  }),
  plugins: [
    // Add plugins here
    new CamelCasePlugin(),
  ],
})
```

For implementation examples and advanced usage, see:

- [Deduplicating Joins Recipe](/docs/recipes/deduplicate-joins)
- [DeduplicateJoinsPlugin API documentation](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/DeduplicateJoinsPlugin.html)

## Available Built-in Plugins

### CamelCasePlugin

The CamelCasePlugin automatically handles the conversion between database and JavaScript naming conventions:

- **Purpose**: Transforms snake_case database identifiers to camelCase in your JavaScript code
- **Use Case**: Ideal when working with databases that follow SQL naming conventions (snake_case) while maintaining JavaScript conventions (camelCase) in your application code
- **Example**:
  - Database column: `user_name`
  - JavaScript property: `userName`

For detailed configuration options, refer to the [CamelCasePlugin API documentation](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/CamelCasePlugin.html).

### DeduplicateJoinsPlugin

The DeduplicateJoinsPlugin optimizes your queries by eliminating redundant join operations:

- **Purpose**: Automatically removes duplicate JOIN clauses from your queries
- **Benefits**:
  - Improves query performance
  - Reduces complexity in generated SQL
  - Prevents unintended cartesian products
- **Use Case**: Particularly valuable in complex queries with multiple joins that might accidentally introduce duplicates
